# ü™ê Experiments with 20th-Century Speculative Fiction in HathiTrust

In order to make books that are still under copyright available for computational text analysis, HathiTrust Research Center has devised a machine-readable data format called Extracted Features. This repository contains data and Jupyter Notebooks for analyzing over three thousand works of speculative fiction in HathiTrust, all published between 1900-1999.

The tutorials here assume a working familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks. For those new to both, *The Programming Historian's* ["Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks"](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/jupyter-notebooks) by Quinn Dombrowski, Tassie Gniady, and David Kloster is a great starting point. We'll also be working with Pandas, a Python library for working with tabular data. Melanie Walsh's Intro to Cultural Analytics course includes a fantastic [overview of Pandas](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/03-Data-Analysis/00-Data-Analysis.html) (as well as the conceptual and ethical challenges inherent to data work in the humanities).
